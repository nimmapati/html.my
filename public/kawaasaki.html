<p>As mind-boggling as the Kawasaki Ninja H2R is, you wont be able take it out on the road and flaunt it because 
its not road-legal. However, this track-only motorcycle will grab eyeballs and drop jaws at track days, mainly 
 for its sheer price and the engineering marvel that it is. Its supercharged, 998cc,  inline-four motor produces 
 as much as 305.7bhp which can be further bumped up to 321.8 with RAM Air. Theres more to the bike than the just 
 insanely powerful engine and you have to shell out Rs. 79.90 lakh for all of it.</p>
