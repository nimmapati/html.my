<p>The Ducati Panigale V4 R might not be as special as the Kawasaki Ninja H2R, mainly in terms of engine specifications, but it can be ridden on the road. And unless you’ve got riding skills to match with Valentino Rossi, the slight dearth in power output over the H2R will never be noticed. The 998cc, V4 engine of this Italian beauty makes 221bhp and 112Nm. It’s crammed with electronic aids to the brim, the hardware package is world-class, and an abundance of carbon fiber components means it weighs just 193kg. Ducati demands Rs. 70 lakh for this homologation special offering.</p>
