<p>Just like the Panigale V4 R, the BMW M 1000 RR is another WSBK homologation special which represents the German brand’s racing prowess. Do not mistake this for the S 1000 RR’s fancier-looking iteration since BMW has even revised its chassis to make it more track-worthy. BMW has bestowed it with a plethora of carbon fiber parts, more so for the Competition variant. This 209bhp, 999cc beast sets you back by Rs. 49 lakh if you choose the standard trim while the Competition model demands Rs. 6 lakh premium.</p>
