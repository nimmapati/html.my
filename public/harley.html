<p>If flamboyance is somewhere on top of your list of requirements then the Harley-Davidson Road Glide Special is the one to go for. The bulbous batwing-style fairing and massive panniers give it such a road presence that even four-wheelers should make way for it on the road. And itâ€™s not just all show because Harley has equipped the bike with a long list of comfort and entertainment-oriented features along with a 1,868cc, V-twin powerhouse that produces 92.5bhp and 158Nm. Rs. 41.79 lakh is what you need to shell out to bring home this American intercontinental mile-muncher.
