<p>The Honda Goldwing Tour offers almost the same amount of flamboyance as the Harley but with better reliability, finesse, and refinement. The 1,833cc, flat-six engine of the Goldwing is a peach and offers a level of smoothness that’s difficult to match by any other engine configuration. Adding to the seamless experience is its seven-speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) system. Moreover, this is the only production bike in the world that gets airbag as standard and that’s just one example of the insane gadgetry it packs in. It is priced at Rs. 39.20 lakh.</p>
